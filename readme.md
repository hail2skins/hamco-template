Basic Bootstrap 5 template for my personal Hamco website.

Uses Golang and Gin Gonic.  

Can be adapted for future sites with tweaks so will put this in a repo to grab from later.

Almost complete with the template.

Temporarily blocked any signups as I don't need any.  

There is an issue with creating notes taking you to the not logged in path even though the note was created.

Many other things too.  Will get to it eventually.
