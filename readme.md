Basic Bootstrap 5 template for my personal Hamco website.

Uses Golang and Gin Gonic.  

Can be adapted for future sites with tweaks so will put this in a repo to grab from later.

Almost complete with the template.

Temporarily blocked any signups as I don't need any.  

Closer.  Many helper functions added.  Cleared a couple weird issues.  Problem now is on auth failure it takes you to the right page, but the wrong way.

I think I need to take you to that page again through the controller, but am entering a loop due to helpers.  May have to re-organize here.
